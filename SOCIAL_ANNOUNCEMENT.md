**Title:** `leptos-state` v0.1.0 - State Management Library for Leptos Applications

**Content:**
I'm excited to share the initial release of `leptos-state`, a comprehensive state management library for Leptos applications!

**What it offers:**
- XState-inspired state machines with hierarchical states
- Zustand-inspired reactive stores with middleware
- Built-in DevTools and time-travel debugging
- Performance optimized for WASM
- Strong type safety powered by Rust

**Key Features:**
- 90+ tests passing with 100% success rate
- 3 complete example applications (Todo, Analytics Dashboard, Traffic Light)
- Comprehensive documentation and API reference
- MIT licensed and open source

**Why I built this:**
Leptos is an amazing framework, but I found myself wanting more sophisticated state management patterns. This library brings the best of XState and Zustand to the Rust/Leptos ecosystem.

**Getting Started:**
```bash
cargo add leptos-state
```
