## Conclusion

Our ADR compliance strategy has made significant progress, particularly in TDD implementation and Leptos version support. The foundation is solid, but we need to focus on automation, documentation, and community engagement to achieve full compliance.

The updated ADRs provide a clear roadmap for excellence, and with focused effort on the high-priority items, we can achieve comprehensive compliance within the next 2-3 months.

**Next Steps**: Begin implementation of high-priority ADRs (PNPM and Rust standards) while maintaining the excellent progress on TDD and version support.
