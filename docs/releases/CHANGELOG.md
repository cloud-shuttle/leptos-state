- **0.1.0**: Initial release with core functionality
- **Unreleased**: Development version with latest features

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

**Leptos 0.8+ Migration**: This release includes full compatibility with Leptos 0.8+.

#### Breaking Changes
- **Signal APIs**: Updated to use `create_rw_signal` instead of `create_signal`
- **View Macros**: Updated to use latest Leptos 0.8+ view syntax
- **Dependencies**: Requires Leptos 0.8+ (no longer compatible with 0.6/0.7)

#### Migration Steps
1. Update your `Cargo.toml` to use `leptos = "0.8"`
2. Update signal creation from `create_signal` to `create_rw_signal`
3. Update view macros to use latest Leptos 0.8+ syntax
4. Test your application thoroughly

#### Compatibility Layer
The library includes a compatibility layer to help with migration. See [COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for detailed information.

### From 0.0.x to 0.1.0

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed.
