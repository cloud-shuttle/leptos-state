### **Example: Basic State Machine**

**leptos-state (Rust):**
```rust
use leptos_state::machine::*;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Default)]
enum TrafficState {
    #[default]
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Default)]
enum TrafficEvent {
    #[default]
    Timer,
}

let machine = MachineBuilder::<TrafficContext, TrafficEvent>::new()
    .initial("red")
    .state("red")
        .on(TrafficEvent::Timer, "yellow")
    .state("yellow")
        .on(TrafficEvent::Timer, "green")
    .state("green")
        .on(TrafficEvent::Timer, "red")
    .build();
```

**XState (JavaScript):**
```javascript
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const trafficMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'traffic',
  initial: 'red',
  states: {
    red: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'yellow'
      }
    },
    yellow: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'green'
      }
    },
    green: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'red'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

    .with_lazy_loading()                 // Enable lazy loading
    .without_features(&["debug"])        // Remove debug features
    .optimize_for_wasm();                // WASM-specific optimizations

// Analyze bundle composition
let analysis = machine.analyze_bundle();
println!("Total size: {}KB", analysis.total_size / 1024);
println!("Features: {:?}", analysis.features);
```
