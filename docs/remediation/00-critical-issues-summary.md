# Critical Issues Summary - Leptos State Library

**Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: CRITICAL - Multiple production-blocking issues identified  
**Engineer**: Staff-level review conducted

## Executive Summary

The leptos-state library is currently in a "large prototype" stage with significant technical debt that prevents production readiness. While the vision is strong (XState-like state machines + Zustand-style stores), critical implementation gaps and architectural issues must be resolved.

## Critical Issues (P0 - Production Blockers)

### 1. **Feature Flag System Broken** 
- **Impact**: HIGH - Features advertised but not compilable
- **Details**: Features like `visualization`, `integration`, `documentation`, `codegen`, `performance`, `testing`, `persist`, `wasm` are referenced but not declared in `Cargo.toml`
- **Timeline**: 2 days

### 2. **Stub Implementations Losing Data**
- **Impact**: HIGH - Silent data loss in production  
- **Details**: 
  - `MemoryBackend::save/remove` are NO-OPs
  - `Transition` and `StateNode` clone implementations drop guards/actions
- **Timeline**: 1 week

### 3. **File Size Violations (9+ files over 300 lines)**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Maintainability and testability issues
- **Details**: `machine/core.rs` at 1,411 lines, multiple files 600+ lines
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks

### 4. **Test Coverage False Positive**
- **Impact**: HIGH - Unknown actual code coverage
- **Details**: Tests run only on default features (none), missing contract tests
- **Timeline**: 1 week

### 5. **Rust Version Behind**
- **Impact**: LOW - Missing latest features and security fixes
- **Details**: Using Rust 1.89.0, latest is 1.90.0 (Sept 18, 2025)
- **Timeline**: 1 day

## Remediation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | Timeline | Risk |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| P0 | Feature flags + CI | 2 days | Production blocker |
| P0 | Stub implementations | 1 week | Data loss |
| P1 | Test coverage system | 1 week | Quality assurance |
| P1 | API contracts | 2 weeks | Breaking changes |
| P2 | File refactoring | 3 weeks | Technical debt |
| P2 | Documentation | 4 weeks | Developer experience |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This sprint): Fix feature flags and CI pipeline
2. **Week 1-2**: Implement proper persistence and clone semantics  
3. **Week 3-4**: Establish real test coverage and contract testing
4. **Month 2**: Refactor large files and improve architecture
5. **Month 3**: Complete documentation and API stability

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All advertised features compile and pass tests
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage with real feature-gated testing
- [ ] No files over 300 lines
- [ ] API contracts with semver compatibility testing
- [ ] Production-ready persistence backends
- [ ] Comprehensive design documentation

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 months with 1-2 senior engineers
